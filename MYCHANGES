The following changes were made for Lab3 and Assignment 2b. Submission:

Changes in ast.cc and ast.hh
    
    Definition changes in ast.hh
	    Added an arithOp array to print enum ArithOp
	    Renamed opNames array to boolOp

	    Added a new class: Type_Expression_Ast
	    Added a new class: Unary_Ast

	    Renamed class Expression_Ast to Boolean_Ast
	    
	    Added check_ast for Boolean_Ast and Arithmetic_Ast

	 Changes in ast.cc
	 	Added a new library iomanip for precision printing of floating point and double values
	 	Added all function definitions corresponding to new classes added
	 	Added function body corresponding to check_ast for class Boolean_Ast and Arithmetic_Ast
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in parser.yy
    Renamed Expression_Ast to Boolean_Ast
    
    Added actions to all the production rules
    For the above part: 
    	Data_Type dt;
    	%type <dt> type_specifier was added
    	All other types were defined in previous version itself
    	Action rules corrsponding to arithmetic_expression were added
    	Action rules corresponding to type_specifier were added

    Changed a grammar rule:
	    	'(' type_specifier ')' atomic_expression
	    	{
	    	    $$=$4;
	    	    $$= new Type_Expression_Ast($4,$2);
	    	
	    	}
	    This rule was shifted from type_expression to atomic_expression
	    Doing this makes sure -(type_specifier) atomic_expression are recognised


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in local-environment.hh local-environment.cc
	Changes in local-environment.hh
	    Updated Result_Enum by adding float_result , double_result and return_result
	    Added a new struct Result for returning result.
	    Changed return type of get_value() from int to the struct Result
	    Changed parameter of set_value() to Result
	    Added classes Eval_Result_Value_Float and Eval_Result_Value_Double.

	 Changes in local-environment.cc
	 	Changed print method of Local_Environment to print the value of the variable 
	 	according to its type
	 	Added method definitions corresponding to the new classes added.
	 	Defined all the virtual functions
	 	Changed return type of get_value() to the struct Result which comprises of a double value 
	 	and an integer specifying its type.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in symbol-table.hh and symbol-table.cc
	Changes in symbol-table.hh
		Added new values in the enum Data_Type: float_data_type, double_data_type, return_data_type
	Changes in symbol-table.cc
		Updated the parameter of set_value wherever required


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in procedure.cc
	Added a new condition to break evaluation of the procedure if a return statement is found.

Also we have made sure that there are no shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflicts by assigning appropriate associative rules!
